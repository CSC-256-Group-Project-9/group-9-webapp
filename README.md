# Group 9 WebApp WIP - Currently in development


### Links for WebApp
- [Unofficial](https://group-9-unofficial.vercel.app/) - The base version of the WebApp for inital testing - DEPRECATED
-[Official](https://group-9-webapp-official.vercel.app/) - Current Official version of WebApp, updates with each Repo merge

### Current Ideas:
  - Create a WebApp with a HTML/JS (maybe react) Front End with a Python backend using Flask
  - Seperate pages to allow isolated testing via Selenium. (Frontend page that has a bunch of FE components to test, Backend page to test backend (JSON parsing, endpoints, etc))
